# BSI_bruteforce
Repository made for the purposes of my CS studies - task with brute-force breaking of a given message encrypted with DES algorithm. Written in CPP, using concurrency.

For cryptographic purposes, Crypto++ library was used.
Code documented with Doxygen.
Note: currently password and plaintext are hardcoded for the sake of determining the time needed for broking the DES algorithm.

Team-work. Authors: Kacper Nowak, Jakub Ziółkowski.
